I wanted to build a budget app to track my spending. This gets access to a bank account using plaids api as a middle man to auth with your bank.

Working on:
- Making login system
- Making visualized report of transactions pulled from bank via PLAID

This is all using a sandbox account for now because im waiting to get verified by PLAID for the developer account to use real data.
